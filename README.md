# The simple utility plugin for Spigot.

Cerulean is the utility plugin for server admins that need a simple solution that doesn't bloat their server with unnecessary commands and features. Each feature is individually toggleable, meaning that whatever features you don't need to use can be disabled in the configuration file.
