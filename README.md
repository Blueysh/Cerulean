# The simple utility plugin for Spigot.

Cerulean is the utility plugin for server admins who need a simple solution that doesn't bloat their server with unnecessary commands and features. Each feature is individually customizable and toggleable, and features that you disable don't get loaded, meaning that the plugin won't register things it's been told not to.

### What features does it have?
- Player Logging (Join & Quit Messages)
- Invsee
- Fly
- More on the way!
